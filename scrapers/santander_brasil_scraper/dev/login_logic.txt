to log in, the website:
1.1. generates local pu key and additional keys which will be used later
   to sign remote pu key. It stores these keys in window object.
1.2. gets remote pu key from additional http request (with local pu key as arg)
1.3. encrypts remote pu key using keys from step 1

To implement this behavior, the scraper sends all keys as JSON when calls
santander_encrypter.js

santander_encrypter.js can (and should) be called 2 times:
2.1. without args - to obtain [1.1]
2.2. with args (all keys, username_third, userpass_third) - to obtain [1.3]

Since the PRE_login.html available only temporary after 2nd login step,
and the DLECC.js will be loaded only when this page loaded,
set breakpoints in webbrowser to getpwd() in DUMMY.html.
When this breakpoint triggered, it is possible to inspect just loaded DLECC.js
and se breakpoints their.
