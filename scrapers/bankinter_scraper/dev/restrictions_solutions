mobile app can be used for personal access only
for company only website can be used

several tabs for session not allowed. at least, each session remembers last position at the website (try to clone the session?)


you can change IP during the session

multiple sessions are allowed

== SOLUTION ==

step1
log in using selenium
get balances overview for each company (or even just list of companies)
then log in to process each account to get movements (before try to copy session and make requests using copied sessions)

step2
if there are no possibility to successfully clone session and process several accounts from one session, log in using requests + external js to generate ecrypted tokens
