The movements of the current day may be moved to any position of the current day.
There is no way to detect their final position in the end of the day:
see Movs__09_10__17_44.png (means 09/10 17:44 ESP) and Movs__09_10__22_11.png (means 09/10 22:11 ESP)
- no any system for the movements from 09/10 - there were reordered 'randomly'.

General ways:
1. fix balance integrity errors manually (the current approach) if auto-fix doesn't work.
2. don't scrape today movements
3. implement more intellectual approach for date_from:
   instead '15 days offset' use
   'scrape since the last date with movs less or eq 15 days offset'.
   That means if there are correct previous movements, doesn't matter how long time ago,
   then the scraper has a possibility to auto-fix the broken movements.
