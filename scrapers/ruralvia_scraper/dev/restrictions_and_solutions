can't use mobile app ruralvia for development - the app stops when using proxy; it can be passed using burpsuite without hidden mode, but the app still falls when trying to select organization -> try web

several sessions per user account are allowed
when selected an organization, can't process another organization
several tabs are allowed, not necessary to log in to execute requests for each account?


movements: if only one account per organization (contract) - the app uses this account instead of suggesting the dropdown to select the account when clicked at Movements link
parse excel to get more than 50 movements from web

== SOLUTION ==
log in using requests (check generated cookies)
get list of organizations

log in necessary times to process each organization in parallel mode
process each organization:
  get list of accounts from Initio tab and upload the data
  switch to Cuentas tab
  process each account from dropdown parallel:
    get list of movements and upload
