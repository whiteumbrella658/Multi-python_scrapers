Movements temp_balance calculation:
  1. the website shows the only today's open (Start of day cleared)
  and the current balance (Today's cleared) of an account even during movs filtering

  2. today's movements (future movements) have no temp_balance and extended description information
  3. in an exported excel file, there is no field 'temp_balance'

  Can't set date_to greater than next working day

Solution:
 calculate temp_balances in excel from the current account balance
 set date_to = date of the most recemt movement
 if date_to < today then
  get temp_balance of the most recent movement from the page
  use this temp_balance to calculate temp balances in excel
