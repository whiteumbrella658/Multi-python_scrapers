Hi Vladimir.



Here you have the updated document of the new development of SABADELL POS Financial Collections (-u 198549 -a 30623) .



I mention an important fact that was not in the document that I sent yesterday. The field 'POSFinancialCollectionId' of the table [lportal]. [Dbo]. [_ TesoraliaPOSFinancialCollectionsStatements] by default must be '-1' to identify remittances pending to be linked. We keep this that way as it is programmed this way for other clients.
