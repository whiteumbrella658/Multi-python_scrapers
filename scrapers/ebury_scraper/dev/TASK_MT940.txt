Hi Vladimir,

Please find enclosed the updated version of the Ebury scraper.

As you can see, we want to implement a MT940 file download strategy exactly in the same way we do for N43

Things to have in mind:
    I need you to implement a MT940 main launcher orchestrator. I’ll provide you the two required stored procedures for this week
        - ActiveCustomersForNightlyBatch_MT940
        - CustomerFinancialEntityAccessWithCodeByCustomerId_MT940
    I need you to implement for Ebury a per account level download strategy. You can see the details on the enclosed file. I’ll prepare the account level required sp this week
        - GetLastStatementDateFromAccount_MT940
    Please initially focus on implementing the scraping steps while I provide you the sp’s
    I’ll share with you the specific network folder to place the files in PRE and PRO environments
    Some of the accesses are multicontract (33108)

Please find below a new task we need you to complete on the Ebury MT940 Python scraping process after you download each file and before you download to the destination folder.

    Take an specific substring of the file name.
        File name : 20220411-MT940_Statement-EBPCLI585178-USD.fin
        Extract the text between the “Statement” and the “.fin”
            -EBPCLI585178-USD
    We need you to edit the file
    Concatenate on line started by :25: the previously file name captured string.
    Deploy in PRE environment and let me know for testing before we go to production.

    Thus:
    :25:ES9201520348990060000087 -> :25:ES9201520348990060000087-EBPCLI585178-USD
