several logged in sessions are allowed

accounts overview page does not contain all necessary IBAN data

approach:
  1. extract accounts' ibans in parallel mode and get accounts_scraped from account detail page
  2. update DB with accounts_scraped
  3. extract movements in parallel mode and upload to DB


main flow:

  login
  check
  open page with companies
  run scraping of each company with concurrency call
    self.process_company(company_id))

  FOR EACH COMPANY CONCURRENTLY call
    self.process_company(company_id)


  the self.process_company(company_id):
    log in again to get session or will fall on concurrent scraping of several companies
    open page with companies (again)
    open company init page by resp with company_id
    then call
      self.process_page_with_accounts_details_select_form
    to get acccounts and movements

  self.process_page_with_accounts_details_select_form call consistently
    self.get_and_upload_accounts_balances
    self.get_and_upload_movements


  at this step it is possible to get err message because company can be unprocessible due to unknown by me reasons
  this info will be returned and further processing of the company will be aborted


  self.get_and_upload_accounts_balances
    open page with accounts list form of the company and then
    FOR EACH ACCOUNT CONCURRENTLY call
      self.open_one_acc_details_page_and_upload(s, resp, cuenta_param)
      where cuenta_param looks like '0200001612@01@020.0.00161.2' and all 'prestamo' are skipped


  self.open_one_acc_details_page_and_upload
    will open account details page
    extract account_iban (finally!)
    upload accounts to the DB
    SAVE account_scraped in self.accounts to use it from movements scraping process to get acc details by cuenta_param


  self.get_and_upload_movements
    open page with movements filter form contained account selector
    FOR EACH ACCOUNT CONCURRENTLY call
      self.open_one_acc_movements_excel_and_upload(s, resp, cuenta_param)
      where cuenta_param looks like '0200001612@01@020.0.00161.2' and all 'prestamo' are skipped

  self.open_one_acc_movements_excel_and_upload
    get account_scraped data from self.accounts by cuenta_param
    get date_from
    submit form to get excel and
    get excel as html table (there is no valid excel)
    extract moevements from excel (using safely formulas evaluator)
    upload movements to the DB

NOTE
1. it is possible to change flow to process moevemnts consistenly from open_one_acc_details_page_and_upload (in this case movements_filter_form page will be opened each time) -- more common way
2. it is possible to extract accounts and movements concurrently at same time, but in this case movements processor should be waiting for necessary account_scraped by pinging self.accounts from its thread. this allows to increase speed, but this is
not necessary right now
