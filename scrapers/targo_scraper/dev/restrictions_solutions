there is no possibility to extract all movements at one respone, need to "press" 'MÃ¡s operaciones' link
to get next movements

when filter movements by dates, the websites returns only actual saldo/temp_balance (not the temp_balance of
the last movement of the period) - that means it's impossible to use '-t' param for targo scraping

max period for movements: 6 months
