To allow nightly scraping, in file project/settings.py set
IS_ALLOW_ALL_CUSTOMERS_SCRAPING_RUN = True
(I set it to True now, it was False to avoid unexpected situations)

Then you can start main_launcher without any arguments and it will scrape all customers:
$ ulimit -s 65536 && python3 main_launcher.py
if you start it on the server.
