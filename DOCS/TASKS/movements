Talking about movements integration.
I've facilitated you an stored procedure called StatementsAdd to integrate the movements filled in a Statements variable.
Here you have an example.

-- Statements declaration and load.
DECLARE @Statements AS Statements;
INSERT INTO @Statements ([OperationalDate],[ValueDate],[StatementDescription],[Amount],[TempBalance],[AccountId])
SELECT '2016-12-01', '2016-12-01', 'Gastos bancarios 32432974367', 1200.33, 2342367.75, 1

-- SP execution
DECLARE	@return_value int
EXEC	@return_value = [dbo].[StatementsAdd]
@STM = @Statements
SELECT	'Return Value' = @return_value
GO



Hi Vladimir,
You'll have to take in consideration the time to fill the Statements parameter.

Here you have one c# example on how to fill it in a good way.
