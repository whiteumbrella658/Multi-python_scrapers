Talking about wrong user and password
I've facilitated you a stored procedure called CustomerFinancialEntityAccessSetInactive to set to inactive a wrong user and password access.
Once inactive you won't be able to scrape it because it won't be available through the sp CustomerFinancialEntityAccess.

Here you have an example call:
DECLARE	@return_value int
EXEC	@return_value = [dbo].[CustomerFinancialEntityAccessSetInactive]
@CustomerId = 43129,
@FinancialEntityAccessId = 1001
SELECT	'Return Value' = @return_value
