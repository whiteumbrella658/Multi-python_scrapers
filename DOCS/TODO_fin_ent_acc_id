I've included the CustomerFinancialEntityAccessId field to the _tesoraliaAccounts table.
It should be included in AccountAdd and AccountUpdate SPs and mandatory field.
But if I update the types your functionallity will crash.
When do we include this functionality?

The reason is that each time an account is created or updated is because of an especific scraping of a CustomerFinancialEntityAccessId, and the last CustomerFinancialEntityAccessId must be integrated to _tesoraliaAccounts like the amount and time stamp. Does it make sense for you?

Hi, Vladimir,
I've already included the field CustomerFinancialEntityAccessId into the Account and AccountUpdate datatypes.
Please, review the calls to include this information.
