HOWTO develop a scraper with receipts downloading method (with example on Bankia scraper)

1. Create bankia_receipts_scraper.py


2. Create a class with one method

class BankiaReceiptsScraper(BankiaScraper):
    def download_receipts(self, s: requests.Session,
                          account_scraped: AccountScraped,
                          movements_scraped: List[MovementScraped],
                          movements_parsed: List[MovementParsed]):
        ...
        # the code to download receipt
        ...

        # the method allows to save the receipt attachment
        # and update the DB 'Receipt' flag
        # you don't need other actions to save the receipt and update the DB
        self.basic_save_receipt_pdf_and_update_db(
            account_scraped,
            movement_scraped,
            pdf_file_content
        )



3. Update the bankia_scraper.py (one line of code)

class BankiaScraper(BasicScraper):
    def process_account(self, ...):
    	...
    	# standard scraper's code
    	...

    	# The place, where you want to call download_receipts()
    	# during the receipts scraping process.
    	# When we call it from BankiaReceiptsScraper intance,
    	# it points to BankiaReceiptsScraper.download_receipts()
    	# but
    	# when we call it from BankiaScraper instance,
    	# it just points to BasicScraper.download_receipts() stub
	    # Note: movements_parsed_corresponding contain necesary information to download receipts

	    self.download_receipts(s, account_scraped, movements_scraped,
	                           movements_parsed_corresponding)
        return True


4. Update main_launcher_receipts.py

if __name__ == '__main__':
	...
	main_launcher.FIN_ENTITY_ID_TO_SCRAPER[fids.BANKIA] = BankiaReceiptsScraper
	...


Since this moment if you run `main_launcher.py`, then standard BankiaScraper instance is called
but if you run `main_launcher_receipts.py`, then BankiaReceiptsScraper instance is called and scrapes receipts. Note, that `main_launcher_receipts.py` still uses the standard scrapers for other fin entities.
You have to use BasicScraper version >= 14.0.0

That's all.
