- Hi Vladimir, I've updated the ***_TesoraliaCustomerFinancialEntityAccess*** with those fields,
Can I update the **CustomerFinancialEntityAccessScrapingStateUpdate** SP without impacting your code?
I also will haveto update the **CustomerFinancialEntityAccessUpdate** table data type

[LastHttpStatusResponseCode]
[LastHttpStatusResponseDescription]
This two fields are to store the last http response status
[LastResponseTesoraliaCode]
[LastResponseTesoraliaDescription]
And this two one are to tipify the tesoralia personal conclussion

I've also updated the ***[CustomerFinancialEntityAccessUpdate]*** With the same fields

[HttpStatusResponseCode] [int] NULL,
[HttpStatusResponseDescription] [varchar](max) NULL,
[ResponseTesoraliaCode] [varchar](20) NULL,
[ResponseTesoraliaDescription] [varchar](max) NULL

To update the information via ***CustomerFinancialEntityAccessScrapingStateUpdate*** SP


- Ok. One more time, what should I put here: "
[LastResponseTesoraliaCode]
[LastResponseTesoraliaDescription]
And this two one are to tipify the tesoralia personal conclussion"?
Pls describe it deeper

- This fields are to identify our conclussion
0. Ok
1. wrong credentials (This means that the Access has been locked)
2. Service unavailable. This means that the finantial entity web is down
3. Scraping error. This means that the scraping process is wrong
Could we differenciate this three situations?
